🧢 <b>Appendix for employees who were chosen by the bot</b>

If the bot somehow (<i>unbelievable!</i> 😱) chose you as kosyachnik of the day - don't be upset, because it's pointless to argue with the machine!


👔 <b>Appendix for company owners, CEOs and managers who were chosen by the bot</b>

Well, this is most likely a bug in our system...
Kidding! You're the kosyachnik of the day, admit it!

P.S. But anyway, remember that the main kosyachnik was, is and will always be the creator of this bot
