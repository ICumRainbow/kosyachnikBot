Welcome to the Kosyachnik Telegram Bot!
This bot can help you identify kosyachniks among your employees using Kosyachnik system - the last word in staff management technology.


There are currently 4 commands at your disposal:

/start — this command displays this message. IDK why would you use it in the future, but the bot has it!
/register — use this command to join the game and put yourself at risk of termination! How fun!
/kosyachnik_search — this command runs the main process — kosyachnik search.
/stats — this command shows you current statistics: who has how many points and who has which rank.


<b>Appendix for employees who were chosen by the bot</b>

If the bot somehow (unbelievable!) chose you as kosyachnik of the day - don't be upset, because it's needless to argue with the machine!
Better try to analyze - what are your shortcomings? Do you have more of them than anybody does? Try to figure out what you can improve about yourself as an employee.

Well, this is most likely a bug in our system...
Kidding! You're the kosyachnik of the day, admit it!
